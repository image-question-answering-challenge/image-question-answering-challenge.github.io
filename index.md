# 1. Overview
This challenge focuses on the use of Web data to support semantic Visual Question Answering: given a large image collection, find a set of images matching natural language queries. The task will support advancing the state-of-the-art in Visual Question Answering by focusing on semantic representation and reasoning mechanisms. In order to address natural language queries, participating systems will need to integrate graph descriptors extracted from images to  use structured and unstructured Web data sources.
