### In this experiment you will be shown a set of images and you will be asked to formulate a set of queries and commands following the guidelines:

    1. For each image, formulate as many queries as possible. (just click on the green button with a plus symbol to add another query)
    2. For each query associate images (if makes sense) in the right box. Just click with right button to select them
    3. Prioritize the more abstract queries (which are less obvious). Queries which are too direct such as "Give me hockey images" in the example above should be avoided.
    4. All queries should be full sentences, for example "Give me images of the Winter Olympic Games." instead of "images of the Winter Olympic Games".
    5. Use your imagination!
